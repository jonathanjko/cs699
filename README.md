# cs699
This project designed to develop and evaluate classification models for predicting bullying victims using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The project involves extensive data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing data, outlier management, and attribute selection.

Installation and Setup

1. Prerequisites:
   
i. R or Python for data preprocessing and model building.
ii. Required libraries: caret, ROSE, xgboost, randomForest, and others as specified in the requirements.txt.
   
2. Steps to Install:
   
i. Clone the repository to your local machine.
ii. Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python) or appropriate R packages.
iii. Load the dataset and run the preprocessing scripts.
iv. Execute the model training scripts to build and evaluate the classification models.
   
3. Configuration:
   
i. Modify the configuration files as needed to adjust parameters for model tuning and data preprocessing.

Data Sources

1. National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS):
   
i. The dataset used in this project is derived from the 2013 School Crime Supplement of the NCVS, which includes data on various factors related to bullying and victimization.
